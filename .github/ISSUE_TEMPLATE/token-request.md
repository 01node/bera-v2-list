- [ ] I understand that token listing is not required to use the Berachain DEX with a token.
- [ ] I understand that filing an issue or adding liquidity does not guarantee addition to the Berachain default token list.
- [ ] I will not ping the Discord about this listing request.

**Please follow the format for adding your token.**
