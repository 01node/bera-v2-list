- [ ] I understand that gauge listing is not required to use the Berachain DEX.
- [ ] I understand that filing an issue or adding liquidity does not guarantee addition to the Berachain default gauge list.
- [ ] I will not ping the Discord about this listing request.

**Please follow the following format for your gauge.**
